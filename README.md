# PREDICTION AND OPTIMIZATION OF DRILLING RATE OF PENETRATION

## Introduction

The Drilling rate of penetration (ROP) is a measure of the speed or the progress of the drill bit when it drills subsurface formation. ROP is usually reported in ft/h (field units) or m/h (SI units).
The Major portion of the well capital investment is consumed by drilling operations; hence, optimizing the ROP is a key aspect to reduce total well cost.
ROP modelling challenges arise from the fact that ROP is affected by many interconnected factors which makes it difficult to infer the mutual infect of each individual parameter. As a result, many oil and gas companies maintain data for offset wells in the same field and set many key performance indicators to assess the ROP for any new drilled well using artificial intelligence.

**Goals of this Project :**
To Implement Machine Learning in predicting drilling rate of penetration using :
- Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGBOOST)
- Artificial Neural Networks/Deep Learning

**Source of Data :**
For this project, data was gotten was GitHub and the direct link was referenced in the presentation.
